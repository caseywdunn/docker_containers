# docker_containers
A variety of docker files for development etc...

For more about docker, see my [cheat sheet](https://gist.github.com/caseywdunn/34aac3d1993f9b3340496e9294239d3d).


To build any one of these images, run something like

    docker build -t dunnlab:build-essential:latest https://github.com/caseywdunn/docker_containers.git#master:build-essential
